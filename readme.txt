Connectid Business WordPress Plugin for GDPR Compliance

== Description ==

Safe Online is a privacy, data security and compliance focused company from Copenhagen Denmark. We've created solutions like [Connectid Personal](https://bysafeonline.com/connectid-personal/), [Connectid Mail](https://bysafeonline.com/connectid-mail/) and [TrustedLink](https://bysafeonline.com/connectid-mail/trustedlink-2/).

The Connectid Business plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce helps set up your website to comply with privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that require you to send a copy of a person's data to them when they request it. 

As a website owner and data controller you must verify, document and respond to data requests (DSARs) promptly. 

The Connectid Business plugin makes it easy, with a request portal you can quickly add to your site as a block or a widget. It tracks and verifies requests, and streamlines the whole process with automatic data extraction from WooCommerce.


**Requirements**

You must be a WooCommerce user to activate this version of the plugin.

1. Go to Tools > Connectid Business > GDPR Requests.
2. Click 'view' and log in to Connectid Business.
3. Select the request from the dashboard.
4. Add any additional files and an optional personal message.
